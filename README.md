### About me:
Student of the 54th group of Yandex workshop.
I am 25 years old and I live in a cool city called St. Petersburg.  At school, I was interested in the IT field, but I did not get there.  After working as a cook, I realized that this is not what I want to do.  And it was decided to go to IT, because this is the future.  I googled a lot when choosing where to start learning and the choice fell on the Python programming language.  In 2022, I started developing as a back-end developer.  I will share my path here.
